# Examples

This folder contains examples on how to access and work with the data contained within
output files produced by ``irrad_control``.
The example files work with the test fixtures located within the repository.
To use the examples on your own irradiation files, replace the paths in the examples.

## Reminder

``irrad_control`` produces a configuration YAML file as well as a data HDF5 binary file
er irradiation. Both files have the same name, only the file extension is different (.yaml and .h5 respectively).
For any analysis both files are required.
